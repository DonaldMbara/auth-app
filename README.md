Here's an updated `README.md` reflecting your intent to position the app as a central authentication hub:

# Auth App

**Auth App** serves as a centralized authentication system, akin to Microsoft's identity platform, designed to provide secure, scalable, and efficient authentication services for multiple applications.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Centralized Authentication**: One secure point of authentication for all connected apps.
- **Multi-App Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with different apps, ensuring unified user management.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modern frameworks to support enterprise-level scalability.
- **Secure by Design**: Implements robust security features, including JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

---

## Use Cases

- **Authentication Gateway**: Auth App can be used to manage authentication for a suite of applications, providing a consistent and secure login experience.
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Ideal for applications requiring shared authentication across multiple clients or tenants.
- **Role Management**: Centralized role and permission management for users across integrated applications.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular 18
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

---

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: New users register via a single platform.
2. **Central Authentication**: Once authenticated, users gain access to all connected applications.
3. **Token-Based Authentication**: JWTs ensure secure and stateless communication.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions are assigned based on roles to regulate access across different apps.

---

## Vision

Auth App is designed to simplify authentication and user management for organizations, serving as a secure and reliable hub that can grow alongside their needs.
